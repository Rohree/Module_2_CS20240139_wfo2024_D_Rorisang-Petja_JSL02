# [JSL02] Submission: Debug the DOM

**Issue:** Users can add duplicate fitness goals.
**Debugging Task:** Prevent users from adding the same goal more than once.

- The goal is to prevent users from adding duplicate fitness goals to the list.
- You need to check if the goal being added already exists in the list before appending it.
- Display an alert to inform the user if they are trying to add a duplicate goal.
- Focus on the code structure within the function and how to handle duplicates.



# Solved âœ…

## In this current code users can no longer add duplicate goals
